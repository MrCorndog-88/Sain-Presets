Here are some SAIN presets I created and thoroughly tested on Labs, Factory, and Streets. They're based on 3.9 Realistic Combat Overhaul, updated for the latest SAIN test builds.

- Normal is the most balanced and realistic preset.
- Medium is close to I Like Pain.
- Hard is close to Death Wish.

All versions feature refined hearing for more realistic audio detection.

Important:
HEADLESS versions are not performance-limited — AI remain fully active at any distance, which will reduce FPS.
SPT versions are performance-limited — distant AI are throttled to improve performance.

For most players, SPT versions are recommended for better FPS and smoother gameplay.

Drop the file into:
BepInEx/Plugins/SAIN/Presets, and for Headless versions make sure you have typed which preset you want into the ConfigSettings.
