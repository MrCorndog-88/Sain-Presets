Some sain presets I made one evening and tested a good bit on Labs, Factory, Streets. Based of 3.9 Realstic Combat Overhal but updated for test builds of current Sain. 
Medium is similar in difficulty to I like pain and Hard is similar to Death Wish but with modifications to hearing and vision to make it more realistic and fair. 

**Please note, the AI inside HEADLESS are NOT performance limited and the AI in the SPT version are performance limited**

Please choose the right build for your specs, generally SPT versions are better for most people.

Just click download RAW and drop into your SAIN presets folder inisde BeplnEx/Plugins/SAIN/Presets.
