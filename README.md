Some SAIN presets I made one evening and tested a good bit on Labs, Factory, and Streets. They're based on 3.9 Realistic Combat Overhaul but updated for the latest SAIN test builds.

Medium is similar in difficulty to I Like Pain, and Hard is close to Death Wish but with tweaks to hearing and vision to make things more realistic and fair.

IMPORTANT: the AI in HEADLESS versions are not performance-limited — meaning bots far away will still be fully active. The SPT versions are performance-limited, which helps save FPS. That’s the only difference between them.

Pick the right version for your setup — generally, SPT versions are better for most people since they reduce load from AI far away.

Just click Download RAW and drop the file into your BepInEx/Plugins/SAIN/Presets folder.
