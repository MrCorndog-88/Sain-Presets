Some sain presets I made one evening and tested a good bit on Labs, Factory, Streets. Based of 3.9 Realstic Combat Overhal but updated for test builds of current Sain. 
Medium is similar in difficulty to I like pain and Hard is similar to Death Wish but with modifications to hearing and vision to make it more realistic and fair. 

**Please note, the AI of these mods are NOT limited at all as I couldn't be bothered to change it and I run headless.**

Just click download RAW and drop into your SAIN presets in the BeplnEx folder.
